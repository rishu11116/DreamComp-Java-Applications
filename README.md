This is a mini-project which was completed by me in order to hone my proficiency in Java.During this project,I had developed mini applications based on Java which comprised of certain Banking Applets,Banking Servlets & a simple Download Manager.The Applets & Servlets can be used to calculate various quantities related to a basic financial operation & the Download Manager can be used to download files directly from any Http/Https URL.The applications use many of the important packages & classes of Java related to AWTs,Applets,Servlets,Swings,etc.The GUI Framework used is Swings and hence the implementation of the GUI is really simple and efficient.
